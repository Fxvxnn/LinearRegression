# LinearRegression

The linearRegression.cpp File contains the model and a Function to read in csv Data. I have trained the model on the Student_Performance Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil7280/student-performance-multiple-linear-regression) with an MSE of 4.55.

Since the Gaussian distrubution is in the exponantial Family, we can apply a Generalized Linear Model. We try to adjust the parameters $\theta$ such that $h_\theta(x)=\Epsilon[y|x]$ is satisfied.
